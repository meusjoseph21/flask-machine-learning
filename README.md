# Spam Email Detector with Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the Spam Email Detector application! This project utilizes the power of machine learning to identify and classify emails as either spam or legitimate. The application is built using the Python programming language, the Flask web framework, and CanDo, a machine learning library.

## Features

- **Machine Learning:** The core functionality of this application is powered by machine learning algorithms that have been trained to recognize patterns indicative of spam emails.

- **Web Interface:** The application provides a user-friendly web interface built with Flask. Users can easily interact with the system to check the spam classification of their emails.

- **Customizable:** The machine learning model can be updated and retrained with new data to enhance its accuracy over time. The application is designed to be easily extendable to incorporate new features or improvements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask (install using `pip install flask`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-detector.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spam-email-detector
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
2. Upload the email content or text file containing the email content.
3. Click on the "Detect Spam" button.
4. The application will analyze the input using the machine learning model and display whether the email is spam or legitimate.

## Training the Model

To improve the accuracy of the spam detection model, you can update and retrain it with new data. Follow the steps in the documentation to train the model using the CanDo library.
